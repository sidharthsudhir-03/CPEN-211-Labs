# starter-lab-3
Starter code for CPEN 211 Lab 3

The file lab3_top.sv should contain all of your synthesizable code.

The file tb_lab3.sv should contain all of your testbench code for pre-synthesis
RTL.

The file tb_lab3_gate.sv should contain all of your testbench code for post-synthesis
RTL.

In addition to filling out the starter files you must also add include the following
files or you will lose marks:

1. A Quartus Project File (.qpf) and the associated
Quartus Settings File (.qsf) that indicates which Verilog files are part of
your project. This .qsf file is created by Quartus when you create a project.
It is typically named <top_leve_module_name>.qsf (e.g., lab3_top.qsf) and 
contains lines indicating which Verilog files are to be synthesized.

2. A Modelsim Project File (.mpf) for your testbench simulations.

3. Waveform files: lab3_wave_rtl.do, lab3_wave_gatelevel.do as specified
in the Lab 3 handout on Piazza.

4. The binary output file (.sof) used to program your DE1-SoC.
